  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need to know: UPDATE THIS

  * Your court case information, 
  * What you want the court to do,
  * Names and addresses of the other parties, and 
  * Names and addresses of the other parties’ lawyers, if any. 

  You can find most of this information on other court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }

question: |
  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your Motion, you must file it with the court. This program does not file your ${ form_name } for you.
  
  You may need to schedule a court date for when the judge will hear your motion. The scheduling process is different depending on your location and case type. Check with your local circuit clerk for how to schedule a motion hearing.
  
  Finally, you will need to send your *Motion* and *Notice of Court Date for Motion* forms to other parties in your case, if there are any.
  
  To learn more, read the instructions you can download at the end of this program.
