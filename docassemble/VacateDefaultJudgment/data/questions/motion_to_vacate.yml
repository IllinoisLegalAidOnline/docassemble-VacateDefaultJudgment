  Vacate default judgment within 30 days
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Vacate default judgment within 30 days** Easy Form.

  This program helps you ask the court to undo, or vacate, a default judgment within 30 days of that judgment. A default judgment is a court order that says the defendant loses the case because they did not show up in court.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**vacating a default judgment**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32421).

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need to know:

  * Your court case information, including the county and case number,
  * The date when the default judgment was entered against you,
  * Why you missed the court date,
  * Names and addresses of the other parties, and 
  * Names and addresses of the other parties' lawyers, if any. 

  You can find most of this information on other court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to continue later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some pages have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

question: |
  Default judgment information
subquestion: |
  When you are sued, you have to tell the court if you want to participate in the case. If you don't respond or go to court, the judge can decide the case against you. This is called being "in default." The order against you is called a **default judgment**.
  
  This program will help you make a Motion to Vacate Default Judgment that asks the judge to undo the default judgment so you can participate in the court case. You must file the motion within 30 days of the judgment. If you file after 30 days, it becomes much harder to undo the judgment.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**vacating a default judgment**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32421).

question: |
  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your forms, you must file them with the court. This program **does not file** your forms for you.
  
  You may need to schedule a court date for the judge to review your motion. The scheduling process is different depending on your location and case type. Check with your local circuit clerk for how to schedule a motion hearing.
  
  Finally, you will need to send your forms to other parties in your case. The instructions you can download at the end of this program explain how to do this. To learn more, you can also read ILAO's article on [**filing a motion to vacate a default judgment**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32406).

  **Note:** If the court papers say "In re:" but also list the names of people in the case, you can select **No**. For example, if the case title is "In re: Marriage of Julia Smith and Tony Smith," the names you already entered will be put on your forms so you can select **No**.
